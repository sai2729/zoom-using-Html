# zoom-using-Html

Here we are making the Zoom in and Zoom out of a picture without using any libraries.

    while Zooming Out, we are reducing the width until it shrinks to a certain width of the image using StartInterval function in javascript.

    while Zooming In,we are increasing the width to a certain width.
